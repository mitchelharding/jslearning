                  <p id="java1">An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>

                  <p id="operators1">Programming languages typically support a set of operators: constructs which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically from usual functions. Common simple examples include arithmetic (addition with + ), comparison (with > ), and logical operations (such as AND or && ).</p>

                  <p id="variables1">In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. ... Compilers have to replace variables' symbolic names with the actual locations of the data.</p>

                  <p id="vnc1">In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>

                  <p id="functions1">In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.</p>

                  <p id="methods1">A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods.</p>

                  <p id="arguments1">Definition of: argument. argument. In programming, a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. When an argument is used to customize a program for a user, it is typically called a "parameter."</p>

                  <p id="parameters1">In computer programming, a parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are called arguments.</p>

                  <p id="returns1">Return statement. ... Return statements in many languages allow a function to specify a return value to be passed back to the code that called the function.</p>

                  <p id="chaining1">Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. ... A similar syntax is method cascading, where after the method call the expression evaluates to the current object, not the return value of the method.</p>

                  <p id="strings1">In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).</p>

                  <p id="returns1">In computer science, the Boolean data type is a data type, having two values (usually denoted true and false), intended to represent the truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century.</p>

                  <p id="undefined1">An undefined variable in the source code of a computer program is a variable that is accessed in the code but has not been previously declared by that code. In some programming languages, an implicit declaration is provided the first time such a variable is encountered at compile time.</p>

                  <p id="NaN1">In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations.</p>

                  <p id="escape1">Definition. Escape characters are part of the syntax for many programming languages, data formats, and communication protocols. ... An escape character may not have its own meaning, so all escape sequences are of two or more characters.</p>

                  <p id="alerts1">A method which alerts the user of a specific outcome</p>

                  <p id="comments1">A user response to published content on the Internet, written in a designated “Comments” section, often below the published content: There were many online comments criticizing the author. 5. a note in explanation, expansion, or criticism of a passage in a book, article, or the like; annotation.</p>

                  <p id="jQuery1">jQuery is a concise and fast JavaScript library that can be used to simplify event handling, HTML document traversing, Ajax interactions and animation for speedy website development. jQuery simplifies the HTML's client-side scripting, thus simplifying Web 2.0 applications development.</p>

                  <p id="attributes1">In the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), an attribute is a characteristic of a page element, such as a font. An HTML user can set font attributes, such as size and color, to different values. ... For example, color might be an attribute of a text object, containing the value of "red."</p>
